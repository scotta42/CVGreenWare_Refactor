# CVGreenWare_Refactor

This repo served as a demonstration of the use of refactoring and its affect on code efficiency/ coherence.

CVGreenWare is a prototype app design for class to represent an in-house and web-based pharmacy application. This application demonstrates the use of excel documents and basic security.
This was meant to demonstrate how a user could be created and associate a password with encryption for the user.
As a client you should be able to see medication and request medications.
As a pharmacist you should be able to see medication, add/remove/order prescriptions. 

This project served as a means to demonstrate an application that could be used in an industry setting in accordance to our class project. 
If paired with (a) medication and patient database(s) from pharmacutical companies or created in-house, then this app could serve as a jumping-off point for a pharmacy app.
